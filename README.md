# 🧠 Machine Learning From Scratch

## 📌 Description

This repository is a personal learning journey where I implement **one machine learning model per day from scratch** using **NumPy** and **pandas** — without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn (for training). Each implementation is paired with a short theoretical explanation, and results are compared with equivalent scikit-learn models.

## 🗂️ Structure

Each model folder contains:

- 📘 `theory.md` – Intuition and math behind the model  
- 🛠️ `model_numpy.ipynb` – Full implementation using NumPy and pandas  
- 🆚 `sklearn_comparison.ipynb` – Comparison with scikit-learn  
- 📊 Simple dataset for testing and evaluation
